# CI

This is where i put my projects
for configuring and testing out different ci platforms

* [Concourse](http://concourse.ci/)
* [GoCD](https://www.go.cd/)
* [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)

I will try to create them all as docker-instances, so they'll be easy to run on any system
and so that it'll be easier to follow the installation process.

To run the docker images you'll need to install
[Docker - Lightweight VM's with installation configuration](https://www.docker.com/)
[Docker-compose - A tool for orchestrating multiple docker images](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
