# CI

This is my repository for configuring and testing out different ci platforms

For now there's only two, but in time there'll be more

* [Concourse](http://concourse.ci/)
* [Go](https://www.go.cd/)

I will try to create them all as docker-instances, so they'll be easy to run on any system
and so that it'll be easier to follow the installation process.
