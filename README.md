# CI

This is my repository for configuring and testing out different ci platforms

For now there's only two, but in time there'll be more

* [Concourse](http://concourse.ci/)
* [Go](https://www.go.cd/)

I will try to create them all as docker-instances, so they'll be easy to run on any system
and so that it'll be easier to follow the installation process.

To run the docker images you'll need to install
[Docker - Lightweight VM's with installation configuration](https://www.docker.com/)
[Docker-compose - A tool for orchestrating multiple docker images](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
